# 🧠 JavaScript Logic Training

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript exercises designed to sharpen your logic and problem-solving skills. Exercises range from beginner to expert level and cover core array methods and manipulation techniques.

## 📁 File Descriptions

### 🔍 `finding.js`
- Exercises using `.find()` to locate specific elements in arrays, including nested object structures and conditional logic.

### 🔢 `findIndexing.js`
- Challenges focused on `.findIndex()` to return positions of matching elements based on various conditions.

### 🗺️ `mapping.js`
- Practice using `.map()` to transform data, such as:
  - Capitalizing names
  - Calculating tax-inclusive prices
  - Aggregating nested quantities

### 🎯 `filtering.js`
- Exercises using `.filter()` to extract subsets of data based on different rules (e.g., age, availability, nested properties).

### ➗ `reducers.js`
- Introduction to `.reduce()` for summing values, flattening arrays, and computing totals from complex objects.

### 🔃 `sorting.js`
- Sorting arrays based on numeric or string values, including descending, ascending, and custom sort logic.

### 🧩 `splicing.js`
- Practicing `splice()` to add, remove, or replace elements in-place in arrays.

### 🧩 `seperating.js`
- Learning the spread (`...`) operator for copying arrays/objects and merging updates, including deep object merging.

## ✅ Goals

- Build confidence using core array methods.
- Strengthen your understanding of pure functions and immutability.
- Practice writing readable and performant JavaScript code.

## 📌 Tips

- Try each exercise first without looking at solutions.
- Use `console.log()` to test and debug your logic.
- Refactor once it's working — make it cleaner or more concise.
